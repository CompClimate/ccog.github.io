# Join

The group encourages applications from individuals with non-traditional backgrounds and from historically underrepresented minorities including of race, ethnicity, age, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, disability, economic status and others.

General topics of interest are illustrated under Projects, and activities within the larger climate, sea level variability and lang-range weather are ongoing. Along with research excellence, Prof. Sonnewald is committed to fostering the career development of students and postdocs.

## Graduate Students:

The Computational Climate and Ocean Group participates in several [UC Davis graduate programs](https://grad.ucdavis.edu/graduate-programs):

- [Computer Science](https://grad.ucdavis.edu/programs/gcsi)
- [Atmosphere Science](https://grad.ucdavis.edu/programs/gatm)
- [Applied Mathematics](https://grad.ucdavis.edu/programs/gapm)

Please apply to one of these programs and list Maike as a preferred adviser. More information about the potential projects, required qualifications, and application process can be found [here](https://compclimate.github.io/ccog.github.io/assets/papers/PhD_CCOG.pdf).


## Postdoctoral Fellows

A position is currently open in **‘sea level predictability and machine learning’**. See more information [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd911Ovi26Cb1Y_VKKdTPH9xWa7ePPejppD5aN1rE4HXN03tA/viewform). Start date is flexible (broadly 1/1/2024 to 1/8/2024). Review of applications will start 10/11/2023 and continue until the position is filled.

Please email Maike (sonnewald at ucdavis.edu) your resume and three most significant publications. Strong candidates have published on either oceanography, general climate, machine learning or complex systems.

Beyond positions advertised, Maike is open to supporting applications to [UC Davis fellowships](https://grad.ucdavis.edu/chancellors-postdoctoral-fellowship-program-cpfp) among others.


## Other visitors

Our group enjoys having foreign exchange students, interns, sabbatical visitors from academia and industry, and post-bac research specialists visit. We are open to other arrangements as well. As we expect people to be fairly compensated for their work by their home institution or by us, we do not have volunteer positions available.
