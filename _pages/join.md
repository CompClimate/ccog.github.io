# Join

The group encourages applications from individuals with non-traditional backgrounds and from historically underrepresented minorities including of race, ethnicity, age, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, disability, economic status and others.

General topics of interest are illustrated under Projects, and activities within the larger climate, sea level variability and lang-range weather are ongoing. Along with research excellence, Prof. Sonnewald is committed to fostering the career development of students and postdocs.

## Graduate Students:

The Computational Climate and Ocean Group participates in several [UC Davis graduate programs](https://grad.ucdavis.edu/graduate-programs):

- [Computer Science](https://grad.ucdavis.edu/programs/gcsi)
- [Atmosphere Science](https://grad.ucdavis.edu/programs/gatm)
- [Applied Mathematics](https://grad.ucdavis.edu/programs/gapm)

Unfortunately, there are no open general positions.


## Postdoctoral Fellows

Unfortunately, there are no open positions.


## Other visitors

Our group enjoys having foreign exchange students, interns, sabbatical visitors from academia and industry, and post-bac research specialists visit. We are open to other arrangements as well. As we expect people to be fairly compensated for their work by their home institution or by us, we do not have volunteer positions available.
