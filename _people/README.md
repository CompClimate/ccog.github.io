# README

To add a person create a new file (format does not matter but suggest using an identifier like their name). The YAML front matter then contains information currently utilized by the publications page. The `pub_id` should match what the person's reference looks like (e.g. "M Sonnewald" for Maike Sonnewald using `nature.cls`).

Example:
```
---
lastname: "Sonnewald"
firstname: "Maike"
pub_id: "Sonnewald M"
---
```
